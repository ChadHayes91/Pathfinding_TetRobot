# Project Description

The general goal of this project is to create an almost spider-looking robot that pathfinds to the user's mouse location. Movement is rather limited to only three possibilities. Imagine a regular tetrahedron which "tumbles" from the top most vertex (the only vertex in a tetrahedron which is not a part of the base equilateral triangle); it can tumble to the right, left, or opposite. The three figures below show these three possible movements; the grey tetrahedron would be the final location after movement and the vertices are colored to visually show where each vertex will both start and end up at.
