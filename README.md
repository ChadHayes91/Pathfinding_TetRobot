This general goal of this project is to create an almost spider-looking robot that pathfinds to the user's mouse location. Movement is constrained to only three directions: right, left, or opposite, which is accomplished by the regular tetrahedron core "tumbling" from the top-most vertex (the only vertex in a tetrahedron which is not a part of the base equilateral triangle). This project was split into four "phases" which start simply and build off each other which I've outlined below. The end result of this project (and its visualization) can be found in the YouTube video posted at the bottom of this page. 

#### Phase One: Base Tetrahedron Creation and Movement Computations
We start by creating a circle of radius 200 (200 units in Processing) centered at the origin (point (0, 0, 0)) and create the three vertices at each 120 degrees (2
