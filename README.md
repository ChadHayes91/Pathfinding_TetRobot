The general goal of this project is to create an almost spider-looking robot that pathfinds to the user's mouse location. Movement is somewhat limited, imagine a regular tetrahedron which "tumbles" from the top most vertex (the only vertex in a tetrahedron which is not a part of the base equilateral triangle); it can tumble to the right, left, or behind.
